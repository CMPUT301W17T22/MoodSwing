# MoodSwing
CMPUT301 Team 22 Project.


A mobile application that allows one to post, track, and share their moods to assist in understanding the emotional states and triggers of individuals and groups. **Project Video - https://youtu.be/u7L6nwLyHIg**

**Ensure all location/camera/etc. permissions are activated manually (in settings > apps > MoodSwing > Permissions) before use on later APIs before running.**

**Offline behaviour and functionality is in the offlineBehavior branch, as well as all the work and commits Fred and Henry did on it. It is not currently merged with master.**
